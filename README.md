## Book Abstract

This comprehensive textbook explores the mathematical and philosophical foundations of modern artificial intelligence through the lens of linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning. Written in Hebrew with integrated English technical terminology, it bridges classical mathematical concepts with contemporary AI applications.

Beginning with Descartes' invention of the Cartesian coordinate system in 1637 and Gauss's revolutionary 1801 work on least squares regression, the text traces how fundamental mathematical concepts evolved into the theoretical backbone of modern AI. The book addresses critical challenges in high-dimensional data analysis, including the curse of dimensionality discovered by Richard Bellman in 1957, and explores dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

Each chapter combines rigorous mathematical proofs with practical Python implementations, demonstrating how abstract concepts translate into working AI systems. From vector spaces and correlation analysis to linear and logistic regression, topics are presented with historical context, mathematical rigor, and real-world applications in medicine, astronomy, finance, and machine learning.

This bilingual Hebrew-English text serves as both a theoretical foundation and a practical guide for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, data science, and applied mathematics, as well as researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the linear algebraic principles that make artificial intelligence possible.

## Chapter Summaries

### <a name="chapter-1"></a>Chapter 1: Introduction – The Hidden World of the Vector
**Hebrew:** מבוא: עולמו הנסתר של הווקטור

This foundational chapter introduces the vectorial representation paradigm in artificial intelligence. Beginning with René Descartes' invention of the Cartesian coordinate system in 1637, it traces how mathematical abstraction became the universal language for representing reality in AI systems. The chapter explores how any information unit—an image, word, or patient record—transforms into a point in high-dimensional space.

**Key Topics:**
- Philosophical foundations of vector representation
- From Descartes to modern AI vectorization
- Vector spaces and dimensionality ($\mathbb{R}^n$)
- Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine similarity
- Dot products and normalization
- Practical examples: medical diagnosis, image recognition, word embeddings

**Learning Outcomes:** Readers learn the fundamental concept that underlies all modern AI—vectorization—the process of converting real-world entities into numerical representations that machines can process.

### <a name="chapter-2"></a>Chapter 2: The Information Dichotomy – Curse of Dimensionality
**Hebrew:** הדיכוטומיה של המידע: קללת המימדיות

This chapter examines one of machine learning's most challenging paradoxes: adding more features (information) can weaken models instead of strengthening them. Building on Richard Bellman's 1957 discovery, it explores the mathematical foundations of the curse of dimensionality.

**Key Topics:**
- Bellman's curse of dimensionality (1957)
- Exponential growth of space: $(1/\epsilon)^d$ points needed
- Volume calculations in high-dimensional hypercubes and hyperspheres
- Concentration of measure phenomena
- Sparsity in high dimensions: data becomes "lonely"
- K-Nearest Neighbors fails in high dimensions
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Feature selection and regularization techniques

**Mathematical Proofs:**
- Why space "inflates" exponentially as dimensions increase
- Why $k$-NN distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions
- Volume ratios: hypersphere vs. hypercube as $d \to \infty$

**Learning Outcomes:** Students understand when dimensionality becomes a curse versus a blessing, with applications in medical diagnosis (1000+ biochemical features), image processing (megapixel images), and genomics (thousands of genes).

### <a name="chapter-3"></a>Chapter 3: Model Evaluation – The Coefficient of Determination R²
**Hebrew:** הערכת מודלים: מקדם הקביעה R²

This chapter investigates the coefficient of determination (R²), one of the most fundamental metrics for evaluating regression models. It traces R²'s historical development and provides complete mathematical proofs of its properties.

**Historical Development:**
- Francis Galton: regression towards mediocrity (1886)
- Karl Pearson: correlation coefficient $r$ (1896)
- Ronald Fisher: multiple regression and variance decomposition (1925)
- Sewall Wright: R² notation (1921)

**Key Topics:**
- Definition: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ (explained variance ratio)
- Mathematical proof: why $0 \leq R^2 \leq 1$
- Relationship to correlation: $R^2 = r^2$ (simple regression)
- Three computational methods: direct formula, correlation-based, sklearn
- Edge cases where R² misleads: nonlinear relationships, outliers, overfitting
- Adjusted R²: penalizing excessive features with $\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1-R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$

**Python Implementations:**
- Manual R² calculation from residuals
- Comparison of R² computation methods
- Adjusted R² vs. R² with increasing feature count

**Learning Outcomes:** Students learn to evaluate regression model quality, understand when R² is appropriate, and recognize when it can be misleading.

### <a name="chapter-4"></a>Chapter 4: Covariance and Correlation – Measuring Relationships Between Variables
**Hebrew:** קו-ווריאנס וקורלציה: מדידת קשרים בין משתנים

This chapter develops the mathematical tools for quantifying relationships between variables, emphasizing the critical principle: **correlation does not imply causation**.

**Key Topics:**
- Covariance: $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$
- Pearson correlation: $r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$ (normalized to [-1, +1])
- Geometric interpretation: correlation as cosine of angle between centered vectors
- Connection to linear algebra: dot products and projections
- Covariance matrices for multivariate data
- Partial correlation: controlling for confounding variables
- Spurious correlations: ice cream sales vs. drowning rates (temperature as confounder)
- Causal inference basics: correlation ≠ causation

**Mathematical Proofs:**
- Why correlation is bounded: $-1 \leq r \leq 1$
- Relationship between covariance and dot product
- Geometric interpretation via vector projections

**Python Implementations:**
- Manual correlation calculation (three methods)
- Spurious correlation detection and visualization
- Partial correlation for confounder analysis
- Scatter plots with correlation coefficients

**Learning Outcomes:** Students learn to quantify relationships rigorously, interpret correlation correctly, and understand the dangers of inferring causation from correlation alone.

### <a name="chapter-5"></a>Chapter 5: Linear Regression – The Line That Shaped Modernity
**Hebrew:** רגרסיה ליניארית: הקו שעצב את המודרניות

This chapter tells the remarkable story of linear regression, from Gauss's 1801 prediction of the dwarf planet Ceres to modern Google search algorithms.

**Historical Narrative:**
- 1801: Giuseppe Piazzi discovers Ceres, loses track after 41 observations
- Carl Friedrich Gauss (age 24) predicts its return using least squares method
- Priority dispute: Gauss vs. Legendre over who invented least squares
- Evolution from astronomy to modern AI/ML

**Key Topics:**
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): minimizing $\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$
- Three derivations of the solution:
  1. Geometric: orthogonal projection onto column space
  2. Calculus: setting gradient $\nabla_w \text{MSE} = 0$
  3. Linear algebra: normal equations $\mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}$
- Computational complexity: $O(d^3)$ for matrix inversion vs. $O(nd)$ per iteration for gradient descent
- Gradient descent algorithm: $w \leftarrow w - \alpha \nabla_w \text{MSE}$
- Bias-variance trade-off
- Regularization: Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) for preventing overfitting

**Mathematical Proofs:**
- Why squared error is optimal under Gaussian noise (maximum likelihood)
- Derivation of closed-form solution via calculus
- Convergence proof for gradient descent

**Python Implementations:**
- Gradient descent from scratch with visualization
- Comparison: normal equations vs. gradient descent
- Ridge and Lasso regression with cross-validation

**Learning Outcomes:** Students understand the mathematical foundations of regression, implement optimization algorithms, and recognize when to use different solution methods.

### <a name="chapter-6"></a>Chapter 6: Logistic Regression – From Predicting Numbers to Predicting Classes
**Hebrew:** רגרסיה לוגיסטית: מחיזוי מספרים למחלקות

This chapter extends linear regression to classification tasks, beginning with John Snow's 1854 cholera investigation as an early example of binary classification.

**Historical Opening:**
- 1854: London cholera epidemic
- John Snow's spatial mapping: distance from Broad Street well
- Binary classification: Will a person at distance $x$ contract cholera? (yes/no)
- From numbers to probabilities to categories

**Key Topics:**
- Why linear regression fails for classification: $\hat{y}$ can be $< 0$ or $> 1$
- Sigmoid (logistic) function: $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ maps $\mathbb{R} \to (0,1)$
- Logistic regression model: $P(y=1|x) = \sigma(w^Tx)$
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for parameter learning
- Cross-entropy loss: $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i)]$
- Why cross-entropy is superior to squared error for classification
- Decision boundaries and threshold selection
- ROC curves and AUC for model evaluation
- Multi-class extension: Softmax regression (multinomial logistic regression)
- Class imbalance handling: oversampling, undersampling, weighted loss

**Mathematical Proofs:**
- Derivation of cross-entropy loss from MLE
- Gradient of logistic loss function
- Why sigmoid derivative is $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1-\sigma(z))$
- Softmax function properties and derivation

**Python Implementations:**
- Binary logistic regression from scratch
- ROC curve visualization with AUC calculation
- Softmax regression on Iris dataset (3-class)
- Threshold tuning for precision-recall trade-off

**Learning Outcomes:** Students learn to extend linear methods to classification, understand probabilistic interpretation of predictions, evaluate classifiers properly, and handle multi-class problems.
